# FraudDetection

Leveraged advanced anomaly detection techniques, including Isolation Forest and Autoencoders, to accurately identify fraudulent transactions within a highly imbalanced credit card dataset. This project was developed as part of AI4ALL's Ignite program, which provides cutting-edge resources and mentorship in AI.

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Credit card fraud poses significant risks to financial institutions and customers, resulting in billions of dollars in losses annually. This project aims to enhance fraud detection by applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. The impact of this work is twofold: improving financial security and enhancing customer trust in online transactions.

## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

Applied the following methodologies to achieve project goals:

- Preprocessed the dataset using feature scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to handle its high dimensionality.
- Employed Isolation Forest and Autoencoder Neural Networks as unsupervised learning models to identify anomalous transactions.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC to understand strengths and trade-offs.
